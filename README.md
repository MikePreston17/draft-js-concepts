## What does Toolbox require?

### The following are the bare bones I will create for practice and possibly put in our editor remake if there is one.

1. The only enhancement I want to do is to make these killable, meaning I want to be able to opt-in so as not to be stuck with a command set that doesn't work.
2. Every command should be tied to a single button or context menu choice.

### Needful (Stage 1):

- [x] Bold, Italic, Underline
- [x] simplest possible manual hyperlink creation (do not worry about detection for now)
- [x] coloring text
- [X] H1 - H6.
- [X] Clear formatting button
- [ ] Quotations button
- [ ] Paragraph (indents) buttons
- [x] Print out html to console
- [x] global theming and color pallete

### Stage 2

- [ ] Flexboxes around the Editor and panels
- [ ] export html state to firestorter or file
- [ ] add inline styles to html outputs

### Stage 3
- [ ] Strikethrough button
- [ ] Alignment (left, right, center)
- [ ] highlighting text

### Consider/Optional

- [ ] Boldify/Italicize Quotations.
