## What does Toolbox require?

### The following are the bare bones I will create for practice and possibly put in our editor remake if there is one.

1. The only enhancement I want to do is to make these killable, meaning I want to be able to opt-in so as not to be stuck with a command set that doesn't work.
2. Every command should be tied to a single button or context menu choice.

Needful:

- [x] Bold, Italic, Underline
- [ ] Alignment (left, right, center)
- [ ] simplest possible manual hyperlink creation and coloring/highlighting/underlining; (do not worry about detection for now)
- [ ] export state to a single html string
- [X] H1 - H6.
- [ ] Strikethrough
- [ ] Paragraphs (tags)
- [ ] Print out html to console
- [x] global theming and color pallete

Consider/Optional

- [ ] Boldify/Italicize Quotations.
